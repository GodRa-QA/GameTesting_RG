# GameTesting_RG

Welcome to my game tester portfolio! This repository contains test documentation I’ve created while practicing game testing. I’m currently building my experience by testing video games, focusing on core mechanics, balance, and overall gameplay quality. I’m sharing my work here to demonstrate the test cases, bug reports, and test plans I’m developing as part of my learning process.

## My Approach to Game Testing

Although I don’t have professional experience in video game testing yet, I’m committed to learning and practicing through self-made projects and by testing games I enjoy. I focus on:

- Writing test plans and test cases.
- Developing bug reports and tracking issues.
- Reviewing gameplay mechanics, progression systems, and game balance.
- Practicing manual testing with a focus on quality assurance.

### Test Documentation Examples

This section includes examples of test documents that I've created while practicing game testing. These include test cases, bug reports, and test plans, which showcase how I approach testing and quality assurance in games. I’ll be adding more as I continue my learning journey.

- **Test Plan - [Game Name]**  
  A detailed document outlining the testing approach, scope, and resources required for testing a video game.
  
- **Test Case - [Feature Name]**  
  A set of test cases designed to evaluate specific game mechanics, such as combat, movement, or UI functionality.
  
- **Bug Report - [Bug Title]**  
  A bug report detailing the issues found in a specific game feature, including steps to reproduce, expected vs actual results, and severity of the issue.

I will regularly update this section with new examples as I continue to practice.

## Skills

- Writing test plans and test cases
- Bug reporting and issue tracking
- Manual game testing (focusing on gameplay, balance, and mechanics)
- Basic knowledge of automated testing tools (e.g., Selenium, TestNG)
- Understanding of game mechanics, economies, and progression systems
- Documentation and collaboration
